# SVM method
#In this part, we used the SVM method for image segmentation on multi-spectral and thermal images (with seven wavelengths, see the folder of images and masks in tif). The goal was to separate the leaves of trees (apple trees) from the rest in a vegetarian environment. You can see the training and test images in the data folder. We were able to load only a small part of our dataset. The data annotation was done on the ERDAS @ IMAGE software.
