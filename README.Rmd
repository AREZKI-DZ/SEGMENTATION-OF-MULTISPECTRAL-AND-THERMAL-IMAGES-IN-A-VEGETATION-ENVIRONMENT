#The objective of the study

    In this part, we used the SVM method for image segmentation on multi-spectral and thermal
    images (with seven wavelengths, see the folder of images and masks in tif). The goal was 
    to separate the leaves of trees (apple trees) from the rest in a vegetarian environment.
    
    You can see the training and test images in the data folder. We were able to load only
    a small part of our dataset. The data annotation was done on the ERDAS @ IMAGE software.

    I would like to thank everyone who contributed to this study

    We have improved the SVM model used By [Bérengère Mathieu - published 10/31/2017]  
    ("https://makina-corpus.com/@@search?Creator=bmt") for locating an object within an 
    image. We adapted this model to our dataset.

#### B1...B6 are the different wavelengths.


####The different manipulations :

    we have stored part of our dataset in the data -> data train and data test or validation folder.



####Training model SVM :
   
To train the SVM model, simply add $Train = True$ for the train_test function in the $main.py$ script.
This script uses the $Construct\_XY$ function of the training vectors of the script $train\_SVM$. This script simply loads the masks, it preserves the most interesting superpixels, then saves them in NumPy.npy format in two vector $X$ inputs and in $Y$ output.

####Prediction with SVM:

For the prediction we use $pred.py$, the masks will be saved in the same files of the tif images.

####Accuracy of trained model SVM:

To measure the accuracy or the prediction accuracy of the trained model, we use the measurement function in the $measure\_Functions.py$ script.

We used the script $train\_test\_SVM.ipynb$ to apply the different manipulations and display them on jupyter with the command "jupyter notebook".
